# Lesson_21
# Primary application file
Create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that created will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## General information about analysis.
There are four parts to this Lesson:

### Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract:

Import the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library into KaseiCoin contract:

ERC20

ERC20Detailed

ERC20Mintable

Define a contract for the KaseiCoin token called KaseiCoin, and have the contract inherit the three contracts that you just imported from OpenZeppelin.  Then inside of your KaseiCoin contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: name, symbol, and initial_supply.  After that, as part of your constructor definition, add a call to the ERC20Detailed contractâ€™s constructor, passing the parameters name, symbol, and 18. Recall that 18 is the value for the decimal parameter.  Finally compile the contract using compiler version 0.5.5.

### Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract:

Ensure the crowd sale has the OpenZeppelin contracts for Crowdsale and MintedCrowdsale.  Next with the KaseiCoinCrowdsale constructor provide parameters for all of the features needed for the crowd sale, such as rate, wallet, and token and then configure these parameters for the KaseiCoin token.  Compile the contract using compilier version 0.5.5.
